# Warehouse application
----------------------------------------

### Key action of this project
- Tracking stock movement: The customer wants to keep track of the stock movement in and out of each warehouse.

- Defining warehouse attributes: Each warehouse has a particular size, representing the maximum stock amount it can hold.

- Managing products in warehouses: Warehouses are stocked with products, and each product has a size per unit amount.

- Recording import and export activities: Products can be imported or exported, and during these activities, the product, amount, and date are recorded.

- Handling hazardous and non-hazardous products: It's crucial to ensure that hazardous and non-hazardous products are not stored together in the same warehouse.

- Handling past and future imports: Imports can occur in the future or the past, so the system needs to account for these time frames.

- Checking current stock levels: The customer requires the ability to check the current stock levels in each warehouse.

- Monitoring remaining stock space: It's important to be able to see how much stock space is left in each warehouse after considering the current stock levels.
